# mine-rock-prediction

This project is a binary classification model that predicts whether an object is a mine or a rock based on sonar signal data.
It was built as part of my Machine Learning learning journey by following Siddhardhan’s YouTube tutorial, where I implemented and understood each step from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Dataset :

	•	Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
	•	The dataset contains 61 features per sample, each representing the energy of a sonar return signal at different frequencies.

Tools & Libraries Used :

	•	Python
	•	pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	scikit-learn

Outcome :
The model successfully classifies sonar signals as either Mine (M) or Rock (R) with good accuracy. This project helped me understand:

	•	Binary classification
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Model evaluation techniques
	•	Working with real-world datasets

Credits :

	•	This project is based on the tutorial by Siddhardhan: Watch on YouTube
	•	Thanks to the UCI ML Repository for the dataset.
